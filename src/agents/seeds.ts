/**
 * Built-in seed agents shipped with orager.
 *
 * These are always available without any user configuration. They follow the
 * Claude Code pattern of shipping a curated set of specialised sub-agents
 * (Explore, Plan, general-purpose) out of the box.
 *
 * Seed agents can be overridden by a user or project definition with the
 * same key — higher-priority sources in the registry win.
 *
 * Design principles:
 *   - Each seed targets a single clear responsibility
 *   - Tool sets are minimal (principle of least privilege)
 *   - "low" effort seeds (explorer, reviewer) use cheap models by default
 *   - "high" effort seeds (planner) opt into deeper reasoning
 *   - No memory writes — seeds are stateless helpers
 *   - Skills disabled for utility seeds (token overhead not worth it)
